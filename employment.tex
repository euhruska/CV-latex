	\textbf{Postdoctoral Fellow, Emory University}
  \par Combining GPU-accelerated DFT and machine learning to investigate the drug-solvent interface. 
\entry*[2014 -- 2020]%
  \textbf{Graduate Research Assistant, Rice University}
  \par Determined optimal adaptive sampling strategies for folding proteins and the upper limit for speed up with adaptive sampling. Developed open-source package ExTASY, a scalable and open-source adaptive sampling platform enabling deep learning: github.com/ClementiGroup/ExTASY. Showed adaptive sampling reaches accurate protein folding and protein dynamics.
